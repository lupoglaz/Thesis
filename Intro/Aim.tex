This work deals with the protein-protein docking problem. The aim of the work was to propose and validate new algorithms in the area of 6D exhaustive
search and in the field of ranking the docking predictions. Particularly, the goal was to invent and test new ways to solve general global rigid-body search approaches that
could be more effective than the state-of-art in the field. In order to convincingly demonstrate their applicability, they have to be applied 
to one of the challenging problems, like fitting of cryo-EM electron density maps or rigid-body protein-protein docking and compared to the 
existing programs in the field.
The scoring method has to be applicable to a wide range of problems: from drug-like molecules docking to crystallographic water prediction.
It has to be free of methodological difficulties as in the case of statistical potentials, where the debates about the validity of the reference state 
computations are still going. This algorithm should be derived from the basic logical statements and have acceptable convergence properties.
